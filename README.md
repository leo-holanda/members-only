In this project, a clubhouse is implemented. Logged users can create posts, as well as view who is the author of other posts. Non-logged users see only the content of the posts, but they cannot see the author. Concepts like authorization and authentication are worked on in this project, in addition to basic concepts like MVC and forms already seen in other projects.

In this project, I was able to use some features of the Semantic UI that bring a slightly more pleasant interface despite my little familiarity with the use of front-end frameworks.
